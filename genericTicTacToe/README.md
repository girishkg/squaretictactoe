## genericTicTacToe

A possibly (as far as I have tested) unbeatable **NxN Tic Tac Toe** AI logic, where **linesize=N**

* [GenericTicTacToe.java](./GenericTicTacToe.java) - file with AI logic

* [Thanks to this redditor for finding fault with previous version of code](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3pxdlw/unbeatable_nxn_generic_tic_tac_toe_ai_logic_n3/cwbcp87)
	* Wrote a [test](./test.java) to confirm 3x3 board is unbeatable for all possible moves with the patch
* **To do:** Test 4x4 and higher board sizes

<br>
Here's an illustration of how this AI works
